# Welcome to netEval!


Many advertisers are not sure when itâ€™s the right time to advertise their business in the social network. 
<br>
Consequently, we would like to ask to build a system that will help them to evaluate its worth. This approach will enable the advertisers to improve their decisions. 
<br>

In addition, it will help the owners of the social network to evaluate its worth for more adequate advertiment price. 
In order to achieve this outcome, we will combine some parameters such as the number of users in the network, traffic, usage, amplification
rate, applause rate and so on. Another advantage of the social media network evaluation lays in the stock market, to improve the share estimation value.

To evaluate the network, we attached an example network file in "example" folder above. Download it and press File -> Load a network file and choose the file.

After doing that, the software will proccess the file and extract the data and will load it in the appropriate fileds. Like this:
